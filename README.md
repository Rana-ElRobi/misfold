# misfold
The Misfolded proteins biological database system can serve many automated functions that help in managing, monitoring and updating the biological data related to misfold proteins, In which the system can keep the protein data organized , well represented and updated from papers and literatures  only the admins are responsible for managing everything about misfolded protein data who are Biological Experts members  , while structure of database the only responsible for itâ€™s managing are the Bioinformatics members.  The system give the researcher user friendly website which can search by protein or disease related informations to find misfolded protein related data, in which if the researcher searched on the site by protein information it will open for it all search results of proteins records related to the search input, while if it searched by disease information like disease name, OMIM ID , .. etc  search results will be all about disease records related to the search input.  Researcher in search result page can make multi selection for records and choose specific action to do on them like: Open All, Export as Pdf, Print all records, .. etc.   On clicking on specific record, new tab in the same page will open the record data, In case of Protein record a group of sections will be displayed of the most needed data for this protein record like: Basic information(name, sequence,..etc) , PDB info , Genetics Info, Structure Info (2D,3D), Misfold Info (Type of mutation, position, sequence,.. etc) , Conserved region info (displaying many tools results for them) , also Disease info (List of diseases in which this protein involved it their pathways ).  Some of this data that we represent are fetched from other databases , but Misfolded protein information is extracted manually from papers, literatures and books.
